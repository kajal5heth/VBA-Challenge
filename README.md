Yearly Stock Changes are compared in this file.
This project compares the opening price of a each Stock Ticker symbol on the first opening day of trading in the year against the last day it traded that year.
The project also compares the total percentage change between the opening price and closing price.
In addition, it calculates the total trade volume in number, for each Ticker as of the last date of trading.
The Ticker with the largest percentage increase and percent decrease in the prices, as well as largest total trade volume is noted for each year.
This project is useful for stock traders to compare portfolio performance for the year, as well as show any trends.
